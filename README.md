# shell-helpers
A repo full of helpful shell code snippets

### What is this?

This is my playground for learning shell scripting. Zsh is my shell
of choice but I plan to start off writing these script to be compatible with
bash because a) bash is ubiquitous, and b) there is already a lot of free,
high bash scripting tutorials available to everyone.

### Goals

- learn the syntax
- investigate compatibility issues
- explore existing programs for general structure

### Resources

I will update this list as I go along.

[An in-depth exploration of the art of shell scripting](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/)
[A great intro to sed](http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html)

### Good code examples
