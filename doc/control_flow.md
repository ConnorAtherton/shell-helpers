# Control Flow

Most programming languages like ruby and
JavaScript have control flow and shell
scripting is no different.

- different statements
- different switches

```shell
if [ condition ] && [ condition ] ; then
  # code..
  :
fi

if [ condition ] || [ condition ] ; then
  # code..
  :
fi
```
